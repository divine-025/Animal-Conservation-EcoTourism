Project title: Eco-Tourism and Wildlife Conservation: Analyzing the Link Between Tourism and Threatened Specie
### Project introduction
This project looks into how foreign travel and the state of vulnerable species conservation are related.  The research intends to find possible links and patterns by examining data on protected land areas, tourism arrivals, and the number of threatened bird and mammal species.  The main goal is to comprehend how wildlife conservation initiatives and the populations of sensitive species may be impacted by the expansion of the tourism industry.  The World Development Indicators11 are one of the several sources of data used in the analysis.
### 2. Methodology
The methodology for this project is primarily based on data cleaning, processing, and analysis using Python. The provided scripts are used to prepare the raw data for analysis:
•	Data Sources: The project utilizes several datasets, including:
o	Threatened Bird Species: Data on the number of threatened bird species per country2222.
o	Threatened Mammal Species: Data on the number of threatened mammal species per country3.
o	International Tourism Arrivals: Data on the number of international tourist arrivals by country4.
o	International Tourism Receipts: Data on international tourism receipts as a percentage of total exports5.
o	Protected Land Areas: Data on the percentage of total land area that is protected6.
•	Data Cleaning Scripts: The following Python scripts are used to clean and prepare the data:
o	clean_arrivals.py: This script is used to clean the tourism arrival data7.
o	clean_bird.py: This script is used to clean the threatened bird species data8.
o	clean_mammal.py: This script is used to clean the threatened mammal species data9.
o	clean_data.py: This script likely contains general data cleaning functions applied across the datasets10.
The scripts, written in Python and using the pandas library, are essential for preparing the data from its raw CSV format for subsequent analysis.
### 3. Results
The project's output, including any statistical analysis, visualizations, or key findings derived from the cleaned data, was not included in the provided files. The repository contains the data and cleaning scripts, which are the foundational components for the analysis phase.
### 4. Recommendations
Based on the project's topic and the data being analyzed, the final results would typically lead to recommendations for policymakers, conservation organizations, and tourism agencies. These recommendations could focus on strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of tourism on wildlife, promote sustainable eco-tourism practices, and enhance the effectiveness of protected areas.
### 5. Future Work
Future research on this topic may include: • Increasing Data Sources: Including more data, such as precise ecotourism earnings, measures for local community involvement, and information on other endangered animal classifications (such as amphibians and reptiles).
 • Advanced Statistical Modeling: By using more sophisticated statistical models to determine causal linkages and account for confounding variables, the relationship between tourism and species conservation can be more thoroughly examined.
 • Case Studies: To gain a deeper understanding of the underlying factors at work, comprehensive case studies on certain nations or regions that exhibit a strong positive or negative connection are conducted.
 • Interactive Visualizations: Developing interactive dashboards or visualizations that let interested parties examine the information and comprehend how various factors relate to one another.
