Project title: Eco-Tourism and Wildlife Conservation: Analyzing the Link Between Tourism and Threatened Specie
### Project introduction
This project investigates the relationship between international tourism and the conservation status of threatened species. By analyzing data on tourism arrivals, protected land areas, and the number of threatened bird and mammal species, the project aims to uncover potential correlations and patterns. The core objective is to understand how the growth of the tourism sector may impact wildlife conservation efforts and the populations of vulnerable species. The analysis leverages data from various sources, including the World Development Indicators11.
### 2. Methodology
The methodology for this project is primarily based on data cleaning, processing, and analysis using Python. The provided scripts are used to prepare the raw data for analysis:
•	Data Sources: The project utilizes several datasets, including:
o	Threatened Bird Species: Data on the number of threatened bird species per country2222.
o	Threatened Mammal Species: Data on the number of threatened mammal species per country3.
o	International Tourism Arrivals: Data on the number of international tourist arrivals by country4.
o	International Tourism Receipts: Data on international tourism receipts as a percentage of total exports5.
o	Protected Land Areas: Data on the percentage of total land area that is protected6.
•	Data Cleaning Scripts: The following Python scripts are used to clean and prepare the data:
o	clean_arrivals.py: This script is used to clean the tourism arrival data7.
o	clean_bird.py: This script is used to clean the threatened bird species data8.
o	clean_mammal.py: This script is used to clean the threatened mammal species data9.
o	clean_data.py: This script likely contains general data cleaning functions applied across the datasets10.
The scripts, written in Python and using the pandas library, are essential for preparing the data from its raw CSV format for subsequent analysis.
### 3. Results
The project's output, including any statistical analysis, visualizations, or key findings derived from the cleaned data, was not included in the provided files. The repository contains the data and cleaning scripts, which are the foundational components for the analysis phase.
### 4. Recommendations
Based on the project's topic and the data being analyzed, the final results would typically lead to recommendations for policymakers, conservation organizations, and tourism agencies. These recommendations could focus on strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of tourism on wildlife, promote sustainable eco-tourism practices, and enhance the effectiveness of protected areas.
### 5. Future Work
Future work on this project could involve:
•	Expanding Data Sources: Incorporating additional data, such as specific revenue from ecotourism, local community engagement metrics, and data on other threatened animal classes (e.g., reptiles, amphibians).
•	Advanced Statistical Modeling: Employing more advanced statistical models to establish causal relationships and control for confounding variables, providing a more robust analysis of the link between tourism and species conservation.
•	Case Studies: Conducting in-depth case studies on specific countries or regions that show a strong positive or negative correlation, to better understand the underlying factors at play.
•	Interactive Visualizations: Creating interactive dashboards or visualizations to allow stakeholders to explore the data and understand the relationships between different variables.
